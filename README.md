Nacker
======

Nacker is a tool to circumvent 802.1x Network Access Control (NAC) on a wired LAN. Nacker will help you locate any non-802.1x configurable hosts on your subnet, and spoof their MAC address so that you appear authenticated to the switch.

The name "Nacker" is a derived from the word "knocker" and NAC; coincidentally combining them equals slang for [Irish gypsy][http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=nacker].
